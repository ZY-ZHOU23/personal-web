### 🥣 Ingredients

| Ingredient | 用料 | Amount |
|------------|------|--------|
| Yellow beef | 黄牛肉 | 250g |
| Ginger | 姜 | 1 piece |
| Garlic | 蒜 | Half bulb |
| Oyster sauce | 蚝油 | 2 tbsp |
| White pepper powder | 白胡椒粉 | To taste |

### 🍴 Steps
1. Slice the beef against the grain into thin pieces. Marinate with 3 tbsp salad oil, 2 tbsp oyster sauce, a pinch of white pepper powder, and a little starch. Mix well, then add 1 more tbsp oil to lock in moisture.
2. Mince the ginger, chop the small chili peppers and pickled peppers into segments, and crush and chop the garlic.
3. Heat a pan until smoking hot, then add oil. Stir-fry the marinated beef quickly, adding a pinch of salt. Once the beef changes color, remove it from the pan immediately to keep it tender.
4. Chop the cilantro into 3–4 cm segments.
5. In the remaining oil, add the ginger, garlic, and chili peppers. Stir-fry until fragrant, then add a dash of soy sauce.
6. Return the beef to the pan, toss everything together quickly, then add the cilantro. Stir briefly and serve immediately.
