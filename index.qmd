## Bio

Hi there! I’m Zhiyuan Zhou, an economics and data science enthusiast with a passion for turning complex data into actionable insights. I recently graduated from UCLA with degrees in Economics and Statistics & Data Science, where I honed my skills in data analysis, modeling, and sustainable strategy development.

When I’m not crunching numbers or building models, you’ll find me exploring nature on a hike, capturing moments through my camera lens, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I’m also a proud cat lover and enjoy spending time with my furry companion MerMer🐾.

I’m always eager to connect, collaborate, and learn, so feel free to reach out—whether it’s about data, photography, or the best way to cook a perfect stir-fry! 😊
