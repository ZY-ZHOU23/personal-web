A simple, automated Excel-based solution for effortless sales tracking, data entry, and visualization

### The Story Behind This Project
This project started as a way to help my mom. She runs a small online store, managing every transaction manually in Excel. Since sheâ€™s not very familiar with technology, she spends hours inputting and organizing sales data, which is time-consuming and exhausting. I wanted to create something that would simplify her work, reduce the manual effort, and help her focus on what mattersâ€”growing her business and taking care of her health.
