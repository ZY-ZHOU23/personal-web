This project focused on applying and comparing various machine learning models for stock price prediction to gain hands-on experience.



The **Stock Forecasting project** is a hands-on exploration of machine learning models applied to stock price prediction. Developed using R, it utilizes libraries such as `quantmod`, `forecast`, and `tidyverse` to facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and model implementation. This project emphasizes practical skill development in time series analysis, financial data processing, and predictive modeling, using a range of models.

### Purpose

* Gain practical experience with various time series models.
* Develop skills in analyzing and visualizing stock data trends.
* Practice evaluating the performance of different forecasting models.
* Enhance proficiency in R for machine learning applications.

### Key Features

* âœ…  **Data Gathering** â€“ Automates stock data collection from Yahoo Finance using `quantmod`. 
* âœ…  **Feature Engineering** â€“ Calculates technical indicators like Bollinger Bands, MACD, and RSI. 
* âœ…  **Multiple Model Implementation** - Includes ARIMAX, NNETAR, XGBoost, and GARCH models for forecasting. 
* âœ…  **Combined Model** - Implements a combined model to potentially improve forecast accuracy. 
* âœ…  **Model Evaluation** â€“ Assesses model performance using metrics such as MAPE and MSE. 
* âœ…  **Comparative Analysis** â€“ Compares the performance of the different forecasting models to identify effective strategies.
* âœ…  **Visualization** â€“ Generates plots to visualize stock prices, technical indicators, and model forecasts.
